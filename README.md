# About Me
Iâ€™ve been working in finance since 2008 and building high-frequency trading software since 2019. Primarily using C++ 
or Java (via the sequencer framework) for the core system.

I am a software engineer with a deep passion for algorithmic trading and have extensive experience in building 
end-to-end high-frequency trading systems. Throughout my experience, I have developed a thorough understanding of the 
technical challenges and complex market dynamics faced by today's most advanced organizations. As a result, I am able
to add immediate impact and help firms grow revenues while streaming costs.

My journey in electronic trading began at a algorithmic trading firm, where I developed and optimized high-frequency 
trading and order management systems for cash equities and equity swaps. This experience gave me a firsthand look at 
the exciting world of today's markets and lead to the creation of Beacon Tech.

In addition to my work in electronic trading, I am a life-long learner who always stays at the cutting edge of new 
language features and technologies. This discipline allows me to distill modern approaches to complex problems that 
can be used to advance any organizations strategic objectives.

Through Beacon Tech, I hope to showcase my skill set by building a production quality system.
